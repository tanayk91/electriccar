It is the third most abundant element after oxygen and silicon and the most abundant metal in the crust. Aluminium metal is so chemically reactive that native specimens are rare. </p><p>As the automotive industry begins to pay more and more attention to fuel efficiency, reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and design, aluminium is playing an ever more important role in modern cars. Every kilogram of aluminium used in a car reduces the overall weight of the vehicle by one kilogram. For this reason more and more car parts are being made from aluminium.")

To produce a carbon fiber, the carbon atoms are bonded together in crystals that are more or less aligned parallel to the long axis of the fiber. Several thousand carbon fibers are bundled together to form a tow, which may be used by itself or woven into a fabric. </p><p>The properties of carbon fibers, such as high stiffness, high tensile strength, low weight, high chemical resistance, high temperature tolerance and low thermal expansion, make them very popular in aerospace, civil engineering, military, and motorsports, along with other competition sports.
